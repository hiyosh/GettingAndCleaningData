========================

Project Description:
Create a tidy data set contain the average of each mean and standard deviation measurements
grouped by activity and subject.  The measurements are described here:

========================
Study Design and Data Processing:

Collection of the raw data is described here:

========================
Creating the tidy datafile:

Guide to create the tidy data file:
  # 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create on data set
  # 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation on each measurement
  # 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  # 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  # 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with
  #    the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

========================
Description of the variables in the output file:

The output table has the following columns:
- "volunteer_id" : a numerical value corresponding to a particular human subject
- "activityLabel" : an activity label describing the action the subject was doing
- "Mean( <function> ) " : An average of each of the following <function>'s
	where the function corresponds to either the mean() or standard deviation()
	of the following measurements in each of the x,y,z directions

	tBodyAcc-XYZ
	tGravityAcc-XYZ
	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	tBodyGyro-XYZ
	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	tBodyAccMag
	tGravityAccMag
	tBodyAccJerkMag
	tBodyGyroMag
	tBodyGyroJerkMag
	fBodyAcc-XYZ
	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	fBodyGyro-XYZ
	fBodyAccMag
	fBodyAccJerkMag
	fBodyGyroMag
	fBodyGyroJerkMag

	Each of these feature measurements selected for this database come from the accelerometer
	and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix
	't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered
	using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency
	of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body
	and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass
	Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
		Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time
	to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these
	three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag,
	tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
		Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing
	fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.
	(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). These signals were used to estimate
	variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals
	 in the X, Y and Z directions.
